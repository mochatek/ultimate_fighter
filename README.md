# Ultimate Fighter

- Simple 2D action game built using [python-arcade](https://arcade.academy/)
- You can puch, jab or block as long as you have energy.
- Every time we use a move, our energy will be depleted.
- Every time you eat a punch without blocking, your life is reduced.
- Energy will be shown in the energy bar and will replenish with time. :zap:
- Life will be shown as a life bar.
- Remember ! you need energy to fight or block. so be wise, use your moves carefully.
- One who knocks out the opponent will be crowned the "New Ultimate Fighter of the woooorld" -[Bruce Buffer :sweat_smile:]
